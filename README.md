In this category, I will list some of the technologies that can allow for soft transportation methods of humans and goods.

* **Electric bicycle**: An electric bicycle is a bicycle which has an electric motor and a battery to help the driver reach longer distances, transport heavier goods and/or bike uphill with greater ease.
* **Flywheel bicycle**: A flywheel bicycle is a bicycle with a flywheel disk attached which can store rotational energy otherwise lost when breaking the bicycle, and has a significant moment of inertia. The spinning flywheel disk can then be used to aid the driver through a small boost.
* **Mainspring bicycle**: A mainspring bicycle is a theoretical bicycle which can store energy otherwise lost when breaking the bicycle into a mainspring to be used later to aid the driver through a small boost.
